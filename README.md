# Arduino_Bluetooth
This ties into the youtube video explaining how to connect a Bluetooth unit to an Arduino.

In this particular video I use a cheap HC-06 but there are many similar units. I ran out before this video, but the HC-10 is a better unit with BLE 4.0 which allows communications with iPhones and recent Androids. This particular unit will only communicate with desktops, laptops, and other similar devices.

The accompanying YouTube video is:
